# Smart-Pad
The main goal of Smart-Pad is to enhance and simplify logistics and maintenance of stock. Smart-Pad automates the process of ordering food resources and this eliminates food shortage and the traditional practice of buying things. It periodically tracks, records the weight and calculates the rate of consumption. This can reduce food shortages that are caused by consumption of food resources, if the storage is below the critical level, a notification is sent to the user according to the real-time data and the user chooses his favorable retailer from the list of options and places an order. It also collects the online data about weather and climatic conditions from the concerned systems and places an order for required stock for the selected number of months automatically. As Smart-Pad is used more and more it predicts the date when the stock can be purchased, calculates burnout rate using the previous set of data and presents consumption analytics to the user, it hence helps maintain the key balance between demand and supply.
